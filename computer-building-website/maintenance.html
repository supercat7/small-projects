      <h2>Top Maintenance Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean your PC regularly to avoid dust buildup.</strong> Dust can block airflow and cause overheating.</li>
        <li><strong>Check hardware connections every 6 months.</strong> Ensure everything is securely plugged in, including cables and components like RAM and GPUs.</li>
        <li><strong>Update drivers and BIOS regularly.</strong> New updates often provide bug fixes, performance improvements, and compatibility with new hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Test hardware performance with benchmark tools.</strong> Regularly check the health of your components to ensure everything is running smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor system temperatures.</strong> Keeping an eye on your CPU, GPU, and motherboard temps can help you prevent overheating issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup important data.</strong> Always have backups for your files, especially when you're doing system upgrades or cleaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cleaning Guide</h3>
      <p>Step-by-step guide to cleaning your PC and removing dust:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Power down your PC and unplug all cables.</strong> Always ensure the system is off and unplugged to avoid electric shock or damaging components.</li>
        <li><strong>Open the case.</strong> Remove the side panel of your computer case to access the internal components.</li>
        <li><strong>Use compressed air.</strong> Hold the can of compressed air upright and blow away dust from the fans, heatsinks, and power supply. Avoid using a vacuum as it can generate static electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean your CPU and GPU heatsinks.</strong> Dust buildup on the heatsinks can drastically reduce cooling efficiency. Blow air through the heatsink fins and fans to remove dust.</li>
        <li><strong>Wipe down surfaces with a microfiber cloth.</strong> After using compressed air, wipe down internal and external surfaces with a soft, lint-free cloth to remove any remaining dust and smudges.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean the power supply.</strong> If your PSU has a dust filter, remove and clean it. Use compressed air to blow out any dust trapped inside the PSU vents.</li>
        <li><strong>Reassemble your PC.</strong> Once you've cleaned everything, carefully put the side panel back on, plug everything in, and power up your system.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Additional Maintenance Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Replace thermal paste.</strong> After 2-3 years, consider replacing the thermal paste on your CPU and GPU to ensure they maintain optimal temperatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor your storage health.</strong> Use tools like CrystalDiskInfo to monitor the health of your SSD or HDD and prevent data loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Run antivirus and malware scans.</strong> Protect your system from unwanted software and keep it running smoothly by performing regular scans.</li>
        <li><strong>Reorganize cables.</strong> Tidy up cables inside your case to improve airflow, which can help prevent overheating.</li>
      </ul>
